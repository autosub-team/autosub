\subsection{Description of the message queues} \label{app:queues}

\begin{description}
\item [job\_queue] The job\_queue is used to trigger Worker threads to start testing
    solutions that were received. The messages in the job\_queue are comprised of
    the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf user\_id:} The unique User ID of the user who submitted this solution.
        \item {\bf user\_email:} The E-Mail address of the user who submitted this solution.
        \item {\bf task\_nr:} Number of the task that solution has been submitted for.
        \item {\bf message\_id:} The unique message-id of the user E-Mail on the IMAP server,
            which started the testing.
    \end{itemize}

\item [sender\_queue] If a thread wants to send an E-Mail to a user, the Sender thread
    is notified via this queue. The data needed by the Sender thread is in the messages
    in the sender\_queue. These messages consist of the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf user\_id:} The unique User ID of the user who shall receive this E-Mail.
        \item {\bf recipient} E-Mail address of the recipient (the content of the
            'To' field in the E-Mail).
        \item {\bf message\_type} The message type is used to decide on how to format
            the E-Mail, and whether or not additional E-Mails have to be sent out
            (e.g. when a question is handled). Static messages that are sent to users implied by
            the message type can be found in the directory SpecialMessages.
            Possible values for message\_type are:

            \begin{itemize}
                \item {\tt Task} -- A task description.

                \item {\tt Failed} -- An error message for a failed test-run of a submission.
                \item {\tt SecAlert} -- Scanning the code revealed that this might be an
                    attack on the system, a message to the administrators.

                \item {\tt InvalidTask} -- A submission or request for a non-existent task.
                \item {\tt Usage} -- Message with system usage explanation for the user.
                \item {\tt Question} -- Confirm that a question was received.
                \item {\tt QFwd} -- Forward a question to the administrator.
                \item {\tt Welcome} -- Welcome message to a new user.
                \item {\tt NotAllowed} -- A user who is not on the whitelist sent a mail
                    to the system.
                \item {\tt TaskNotSubmittable} -- A user wants to submit to a task for which
                    he has not received a task description yet.
                \item {\tt TaskNotActive} -- Response to an user action concerning a task that is not active

\subsection{Handling of concurrent testing}
Handling of testing multiple submissions from users is handled in autosub in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple Worker threads and seperated user tasks directories make it possible that
    multiple task submissions can be processed at the same time.
\item Active task submissions are put in an active queue and removed once they have been fully
    processed and an response has been sent to the student. Active task submissions that are
    not processed after 5 minutes are presumed dead and removed from the active queue.
\item To prevent conflicts only one combination of user and task\_nr is allowed to be active at any
    time. If the user submits a solution for the same task before it has been fully processed, it
    will be put in a backlog queue. Tasks from backlog are made active once the conflicting
    submission has been fully processed.
\end{itemize}
