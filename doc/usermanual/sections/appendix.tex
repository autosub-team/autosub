\subsection{Description of the message queues} \label{app:queues}

\begin{description}
\item [job\_queue] The job\_queue is used to trigger Worker threads to start testing 
	solutions that were received. The messages in the job\_queue are comprised of 
	the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf user\_id:} The unique User ID of the user who submitted this solution.
        \item {\bf user\_email:} The E-Mail address of the user who submitted this solution.
        \item {\bf task\_nr:} Number of the task that solution has been submitted for.
        \item {\bf message\_id:} The unique message-id of the E-Mail on the server.
    \end{itemize}

\item [sender\_queue] If a thread wants to send an E-Mail to a user, the Sender thread 
	is notified via this queue. The data needed by the Sender thread is in the messages 
	in the sender\_queue. These messages consist of the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf user\_id:} The unique User ID of the user who shall receive this E-Mail.
        \item {\bf recipient} E-Mail address of the recipient (the content of the 
			'To' field in the E-Mail).
        \item {\bf message\_type} The message type is used to decide on how to format 
			the E-Mail, and whether or not additional E-Mails have to be sent out 
			(e.g. when a question is handled). Possible message\_types are:

            \begin{itemize}
				\item {\tt Task} -- A task description.
				\item {\tt Success} -- A Task has been tested successfully.
				\item {\tt Failed} -- An error message for a failed test-run of a result 
					submission.
				\item {\tt SecAlert} -- Scanning the code revealed that this might be an 
					attack on the system.
				\item {\tt TaskAlert} -- An error message for failures in files that were 
					created for tasks.
				\item {\tt InvalidTask} -- A result submission for a non-existent task.
				\item {\tt Usage} -- An E-Mail with usage explanation shall be sent to the 
					student. 
				\item {\tt Question} -- Confirm that a question was received.
				\item {\tt QFwd} -- Forward a question to the administrator.
				\item {\tt Welcome} -- Send a welcome message to a new student.
				\item {\tt NotAllowed} -- A user who is not on the whitelist sent a mail 
					to the system.
				\item {\tt SkipNotPossible} -- A user wants to skip to the next
					task, when he is either at the last task or the next task has not 
					started yet.
				\item {\tt TaskNotSubmittable} -- A user wants to submit to a task
					which has not started yet.
            \end{itemize}

        \item {\bf task\_nr} Number of the task that message concerns (e.g. the current 
			one if the test failed, the next one if the task description shall be sent).
        \item {\bf message\_id:} The unique message-id of the E-Mail on the server.
    \end{itemize}

\item [logger\_queue] Trigger the logger to write a log message about an event that happened.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf message:} The text that describes the event that shall be logged.
        \item {\bf level:} The log-level of this log message; available log-levels 
			are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR.
        \item {\bf src:} Name of the thread that reported the event that shall be logged.
		\item {\bf dst:} Log destination (autosub log, task message, task error).
    \end{itemize}

\item [generator\_queue] The generator\_queue is used to trigger the Generator thread 
	to generate a new (variant of) a task. That means that certain parameters of the 
	task are randomized, in order to assure that each student receives his/her very 
	own example. 
	\begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf user\_id:} The unique UserID of the User for whom the task is generated.
        \item {\bf user\_email:} E-Mail address of the User for whom the task is generated.
        \item {\bf task\_nr:} Number of the task that shall be generated.
        \item {\bf message\_id:} The unique message-id of the E-Mail on the server.
    \end{itemize}

\item [archive\_queue] The archive\_queue is used to announce that a E-Mail has been finished
	processing. This triggers archiving and removing task submissions from the active queue.
	own example. 
	\begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf message\_id:} The unique message-id of the E-Mail on the server.
        \item {\bf is\_finished\_job:} Flag to show that the message-id belongs to a finished

\subsection{Handling of concurrent testing}
Handling of testing multiple submissions from users is handled in autosub in the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple Worker threads and seperated user tasks directories make it possible that
	multiple task submissions can be processed at the same time.
\item Active task submissions are put in an active queue and removed once they have been fully
	processed and an response has been sent to the student. Active task submissions that are 
	not processed after 5 minutes are presumed dead and removed from the active queue.
\item To prevent conflicts only one combination of user and task\_nr is allowed to be active at any
	time. If the user submits a solution for the same task before it has been fully processed, it 
	will be put in a backlog queue. Tasks from backlog are made active once the conflicting 
	submission has been fully processed.
\end{itemize}
