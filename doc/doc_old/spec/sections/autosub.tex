\subsection{Description of Entities}
\begin{description}
    \item [MB] \textbf{Mailbox} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description & Mailbox to interface with students. \\
        \hline
        Rate & Asynchronously by students, once per minute by the E-Learning system. \\
        \hline

        Comment & The Mailbox is used to interface with the students. In depth description of this 
        interface can be found in Section \ref{emailinterface}.
        
        The Mailbox is accessed via \gls{imap} for reading new e-mails and \gls{smtp} to send e-mails.

        After the action triggered by an received e-mail has been processed, the e-mail shall be archived 
        into a configurable folder on the e-mail server.
        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \item [1] \textbf{Fetcher Thread} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description &  Fetch E-Mails from the Mailbox.\\
        \hline
        Rate & Periodically once a minute (by default -- period shall be configurable). \\
        \hline

        Comment & The Fetcher Thread periodically checks the Mailbox for new mails. These new
        mails are sorted in the fetcher thread an actions are triggered based on the messages.
        To decide which action is the correct one for a particular e-mail, the user E-mail 
        address and the subject are evaluated. The following use cases are possible.
        \begin{itemize}
        \item New user has to be created.
        \item Task wants to be submitted.
        \item Question wants to be asked.
        \item User status wants to be known.
        \end{itemize}
    
        Further Information concerning the email interface can be be seen in Section \ref{interactions} 
        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \newpage
    \item [2] \textbf{Worker Thread(s)} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description & Test the task submissions of students. \\
        \hline
        Rate & Asynchronously triggered upon arrival of a new task submission by a student. \\
        \hline
        Comment & The worker threads are the ones which do the actual work of testing submissions
        by a student. If the Fetcher Thread receives an e-mail with a result submission, a new
        message is added to the job\_queue. The worker threads are using a blocking read on the
        job\_queue to wait for work, as soon as the new message is added by the Fetcher thread one
        of the workers will read it and start the tests for the users submission.
         
        The tests themselves are implemented externally in a bash script. This script is expected
        to return with 0 on success, and 1 if the tests failed. Additional information
        (e.g. error-messages) are expected in a file called {\tt error\_msg} in the  unsuccessful case.
        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \item [3] \textbf{Sender Thread} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description & Sends E-mails to the Students \\
        \hline
        Rate & Triggered by Fetcher, Worker or Generator Thread. \\
        \hline

         Comment & If a message has to be returned to the student, the thread that wants to send the
            message just puts the necessary information into the sender\_queue. The sender thread
            then takes that information, formats an e-mail and sends it out using \gls{smtp}.

            The unique message-id is passed from the fetcher (possibly via other threads) to the
            sender thread. If the sender thread has sent out the answering e-mails, the e-mail with
            the given message-id is moved into an archive folder on the mail server.
             \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\newpage
    \item [4] \textbf{Logger Thread}\label{sec:logger} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description & Format log messages and store them in the log file. \\
        \hline
        Rate & Triggered by all other threads. \\
        \hline
         Comment & In order to enforce a common logging format, and allow the setting of a common
            log-level, all threads just put their log-messages into the logger\_queue. The
            logger thread decides (depending on the log-level) whether or not the message shall
            be logged or not. If so, the message is formatted and written to the log file.

            The following log-levels shall be implemented (from lowest to highest):
                \begin{description}
                \item [DEBUG:] Print all kind of information that might be helpful to debug
                    problems. This includes, what user sent which e-mail, what action
                    was taken, what was the result of that action.
                \item [INFO:] Information that might be of interest, even if not in debugging
                    mode.
                \item [WARNING:] A problem occurred, but it did not lead to a long-term problem
                    (e.g. could not connect to the mailserver, but after retrying it worked).
                \item [ERROR:] A problem that lead to a long-term malfunction of the submission
                    system occurred, the system will not be able to recover from this problem.
                \end{description}
        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

    \item [5] \textbf{Generator Thread} \\
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{11cm}|}
        \hline
        Description & Generate a (unique) example for a user. \\
        \hline
        Rate & Triggered by registration of a new user, and successful submission of a task.  \\
        \hline
        Comment & The tasks are tailored for each student using randomized parameters. 

            The generation of a task is done as soon as it is needed e.g. for the first
            task after the user registered, for all the other tasks, as soon as the previous
            task has successfully been submitted.

            The Generator Thread is blocking on the gen\_queue, until the generation of a new
            example is requested. As soon as the example was generated, a request to send it
            out is put into the sender\_queue.
        \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}

\subsection{Description of Message-Queues}

\begin{description}
\item [job\_queue] The job\_queue is used to trigger worker threads to start testing solutions 
    that were received. The messages in the job\_queue are comprised of the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf UserId:} The unique User ID of the user who submitted this solution.
        \item {\bf UserEmail:} The e-mail address of the user who submitted this solution.
        %\item {\bf message_type:} PRESENT IN THE CODE; BUT NOT USED?? THIS IS GOING TO THE WORKER, SO THERE IS ONLY ONE TYPE, REALLY!
        \item {\bf taskNr:} Number of the task that solution has been submitted for.
        \item {\bf MessageId:} The unique message-id of the e-mail on the server.
    \end{itemize}
\item [sender\_queue] If a thread wants to send an e-mail to a user, the sender thread is notified via this queue. 
    The data needed by the sender thread is in the messages in the sender\_queue. These messages consist of the following fields:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf UserId:} The unique User ID of the user who shall receive this e-mail.
        \item {\bf recipient} E-Mail address of the recipient (the content of the 'To' field in the e-mail).

            whether or not additional e-mails have to be sent out (e.g. when a question is handled). 
            Possible message\_types are:

            \begin{itemize}
            \item {\tt Task} -- A task description.
            \item {\tt Success} -- A Task has been tested successfully.
            \item {\tt Failed} -- An error message for a failed test-run of a result submission.
            \item {\tt SecAlert} -- Scanning the code revealed that this might be an attack on the system.
            \item {\tt TaskAlert} -- An error message for failures in files that were created for tasks.
            \item {\tt InvalidTask} -- A result submission for a non-existent task.
            \item {\tt Usage} -- An e-mail with usage explanation shall be sent to the student. 
            \item {\tt Question} -- Confirm that a question was received.
            \item {\tt QFwd} -- Forward a question to the administrator.
            \item {\tt Welcome} -- Send a welcome message to a new student.
			\item {\tt NotAllowed} -- A user who is not on the whitelist sent a mail to the system.
			\item {\tt SkipNotPossible} -- A user wants to skip to the next
				task, when he is either at the last task or the next task has not started yet.
			\item {\tt TaskNotSubmittable} -- A user wants to submit to a task
											 which has not started yet.
            \end{itemize}

        \item {\bf Task} Number of the task that message concerns (e.g. the current one if the test failed, 
        the next one if the task description shall be sent).
        \item {\bf MessageId:} The unique message-id of the e-mail on the server.
    \end{itemize}
\item [logger\_queue] Trigger the logger to write a log message about an event that happened.

        \item {\bf type:} The log-level of this log message; available log-levels are DEBUG, INFO, 
            WARNING and ERROR (see specification of Logger Thread in Section \ref{sec:logger} for details).
        \item {\bf loggername:} Name of the thread that reported the event that shall be logged.
    \end{itemize}
\item [gen\_queue] The gen\_queue is used to trigger the Generator Thread to generate a new (variant of) a 
    task. That means that certain parameters of the task are randomized, in order to assure that each student 
    receives his/her very own example. 
	\begin{itemize}
        \item {\bf UserId:} The unique UserID of the User for whom the task is generated.
        \item {\bf UserEmail:} E-Mail address of the User for whom the task is generated.
        \item {\bf TaskNr:} Number of the task that shall be generated.
        \item {\bf MessageId:} The unique message-id of the e-mail on the server.

\subsubsection{course.db}

In contrast to semester.db, course.db consists configuration data that will very likely be reused in the next
semester. This seperation makes it very easy to start a new semester: just backup semester.db to some safe
location and remove it in the original location (a new empty one will be made automatically). 

Then use the VELS web interface to perform the small modifcations (year/semester, deadlines, etc.) needed in course.db.
