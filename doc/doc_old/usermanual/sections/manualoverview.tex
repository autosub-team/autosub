\section{Manual Overview}

The following document aims to inform an operator on how to configure and run a course
using the VELS VHDL E-Learning System. Therefore the implementation is only discussed
in depth on a need to know basis. If you are interested in implementation details please
look at the VELS Specification or the code itself.

Section \ref{velsoverview} gives an overview of the whole system. It describes the parts
out of which it is composed, how they fit together and what interfaces to change,
configure, test and debug are available.

Section \ref{logerror} talks about the log and error files of the VELS system.

Section \ref{setup} describes how to set up and configure the VELS System on a given
server. The instructions start at how to configure the server for VELS and then tells
which configurations have to be done to create a course. Lastly a configuration check-list
is given and a way to test the setup before deployment described.
