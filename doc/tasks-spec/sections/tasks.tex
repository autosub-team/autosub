On the other hand, the second section "Timing Demo Task" gives a simulated waveform diagram of 4 signals output,N ,O ,P and E, up to 300 ns approximately. The constraints for the signals, the assignment of a variable and how two processes are triggered are specified in the pdf. The pupil also receives a vhdl file for example, a vhdl file with the entity declaration, which should not be changed and a vhdl file for the behavioral implementation.

        \hline
        Creation & The assigned values of variable and signal N are randomly chosen between 20 to 110 in integer so are the delay timing for signal O, E, and P. The coefficient numbers for O, E, and P signal assigned are generated randomly between 1 to 3. The signals and variable has the following relation.
        \begin{description}
		\item A := A + value\_a
		\item N \textless= N + value\_n
		\item O \textless= c1 * A + c2 * N after delay\_o
		\item P \textless= c3 * A - c4 * N after delay\_p
		\item E \textless= c5 * O + c6 * E after delay\_e
		\end{description}
        ,where A is the variable and c1~c6 are the coefficients.
        \\&
        Only value\_a is given and the rest of the values has to be decided based on the waveform by the student. The generated signal waveform is converted to a pdf file via \LaTeX

        Submission & The student has to submit his behavioral implementation vhdl file.
        \\
        \hline
        Testing & A test bench writes only for a checker based on the timing of given output diagram. No inputs needed.
        \\
        \hline
        Feedback & If the syntax analysis returned errors, they are sent to the student. If the value of the simulated outputs is not correct at the specified timimg delay, the student receives an feedback with the expected values for 4 signals and the shown values from his/her behavioral vhdl file at the simulated time. The checker checks the design up to 400 ns. The student is informed if his/her solution is proper or not.

\section{Blockcode}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{13cm}|}
        \hline
        Overview & The student has to program the behavior of an entity which acts as an intermediate unit between a
			data source and a sink. The job of this intermediate unit is to convert given datawords to codewords using
			(n,k) blockcode encoding.

			The student learns to program an entity that follows given communication constraints (synchronous,
			possible backpressure).
        \\
        \hline
        Description & The student is given an description of the communication system concerning transmission and
			encoding. Additionally a example waveform view of a few communication cycles is given as diagram with
			description for each cycle.
        \\
        \hline
        Creation & The encoding is parameterized with the following parameters:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item dataword length k: between 5 and 7
				\item codelength n: between 3 and 8 (depending on k)
				\item random (n-k) chosen parity vectors, with at least 2 entries
			\end{itemize}
		\\
        \hline
        Submission & The student has to submit his behavioral implementation vhdl file.
        \\
        \hline
        Testing & A testbench feeds the student's entity with simulated communication from a data source and checks
			the outgoing communication in respect to right encoding and given timing constraints. Every testing also
			tests if the student implemented the due backpressure needed FIFO by: a) filling the FIFO fully and b) fully
			emptying the FIFO.
        \\
        \hline
        Feedback & If the syntax analysis returned errors, they are sent to the student. If the behavior is wrong, the
			student gets information about the cycle at which the behavior did not fit, expected outgoing communication 
			and received outgoing communication. Additionally the student gets the signal wave file produced by the
			simulator to help him debug.
