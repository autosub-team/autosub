Hi!

As you probably already know, most programs that are called on the commandline
take options. In this task, you will have to look at how this is done.

You may already know, how options are passed on to your program. If not, you
can find a good explaination here at [0]. Efficient and complete parsing of
those options can be tricky and it is easy to miss something. Fortunetly there
are simple and effictive functions that can be used. In this task you shall use
the getopt() function to add the following options to your program:

hello [-i iterations] [-r]

Here are some examples:

andi@aepfelchen:~/examples$ ./hello -i 4
Hello world 1
Hello world 2
Hello world 3
Hello world 4
andi@aepfelchen:~/examples$ ./hello -i 4 -r
Hello world 4
Hello world 3
Hello world 2
Hello world 1


You can find proper documentation of the getopt() function in the man pages of
your system! (But I guess you already now that!)

As in the last examples, you are expected to submit just one file: hello.c

Looking forward to you submission!
