\section*{Single Cycle Control Unit}

Your task is to program the behavior of an entity called ``SC\_CU". This entity is declared in the attached file ``SC\_CU.vhdl" and has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item Input:  Opcode with type std\_logic\_vector of length 6
\item Input:  Funct with type std\_logic\_vector of length 6
\item Input:  Zero with type std\_logic
\item Output: ALUControl with type std\_logic\_vector of length 3
\item Output: Control signals RegDst, Branch, Jump, MemRead, MemtoReg, MemWrite, ALUSrc and RegWrite all with type std\_logic
\end{itemize}

You will have to implement the following types of instructions:
%%SELECTED_INSTRUCTIONS_TYPE

The ``SC\_CU" entity shall control the single cycle processor depicted in Figure~1 to perform the following instructions:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \Tstrut
		instruction & opcode  & funct	& zero & type   \\ \hline \Tstrut
		%%SELECTED_INSTRUCTIONS
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

%%SELECTED_INSTRUCTIONS_TEXT

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \Tstrut
		ALUControl & Function   \\ \hline \Tstrut
		%%SELECTED_ALUCONTROLS
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{ALUControls}
    \label{tab:ALUControls}  
\end{table}

To get a better understanding of the control signals, here is a description of each control signal. Use Figure~1 to see how the control signals control the data paths.
\begin{itemize}

	\item{RegDst: Selects whether the register destination comes from the bits 20 -- 16 or bits 15 -- 11 of the instruction. In other words, this control signal selects if the destination register comes from rt or rd.}

	\item{Branch: Has an effect on the source for the next program counter value. If the branch condition is met it will be `1'. If the current instruction is not a branch instruction it will always be set to `0'.}

	\item{Jump: Has an effect on the source for the next program counter value. If the current instruction is not a jump instruction it will always be set to `0'.}

	\item{MemRead: When the MemRead signal is set to `1', then the data memory outputs the data specified by the read address input.}

	\item{MemtoReg: Selects whether the register's write data input will come from the data memory or the ALU output.}

	\item{MemWrite: When the MemWrite signal is set to `1', then the data memory writes its write data to the write address. }

	\item{ALUControl: Selects the ALU operation the ALU performs on its two input values. The controls for the available operations are listed in Table~1.}

	\item{ALUSrc: Selects whether the ALU gets a value from the register's read data 2 output, or from the sign extended immediate value of the instruction.}

	\item{RegWrite: When the RegWrite signal is set to `1', then the register writes the write data to the write register.\\}
	
\end{itemize}

Consider which actions each part of the processor in Figure~1 has to take to fulfill the functions of the operations and set the control signals accordingly. This behavior has to be programmed in the attached file ``SC\_CU\_beh.vhdl".\\

To turn in your solution write an email to %%SUBMISSIONEMAIL with Subject ``Result Task %%TASKNR" and attach your file ``SC\_CU\_beh.vhdl".
