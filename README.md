Autosub is an email based system for generating, submitting and automatically
testing student assignments in courses. 

It includes VELS (VHDL E-Learning System) for supporting VHDL
training courses. Students receive individual tasks and submit VHDL 
models by email, which are in succession automatically simulated 
and tested by testbenches on the server. Students receive email responses 
about the success or failure of the test within seconds or minutes.
VELS comes with a set of VHDL assignments for VHDL beginners.

For documenation, please refer to our user manual (https://github.com/autosub-team/autosub/blob/master/doc/doc_pdf/usermanual.pdf) and the specification of the existing VHDL tasks(https://github.com/autosub-team/autosub/blob/master/doc/doc_pdf/tasks-specification.pdf)

IMPORTANT:
The C example tasks given in this repository are not meant for usage, as they
impose a severe security threat if used unchanged -- it means you allow everyone
who submitts to the task to execute arbitraty code on YOUR machine. These are really
just for testing.

The VHDL example tasks are meant for usage.
